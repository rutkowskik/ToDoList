This is a simple task management application created using Java for the backend logic and HTML for the user interface. The app allows users to create, view, edit, and delete tasks in a straightforward and intuitive way. It provides a basic task list where users can manage their to-dos, helping them stay organized and focused.

The application was developed as one of my first educational projects to practice web development and programming skills. It was designed to be a personal tool to help plan and organize tasks more efficiently, serving as both a learning experience and a practical solution for task management.

The Java backend handles the business logic for adding, editing, and removing tasks, while the HTML frontend provides a simple interface for interacting with the application. This project helped me learn about basic web technologies, such as server-client interaction, form handling, and basic data manipulation.
